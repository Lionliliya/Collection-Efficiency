# Collection-Efficiency

**Write a program to compare the efficiency of collection:**

The program must compare the various implementation of collections  performance for the following operations:

List


     add (index)
     get (index)
     remove (index)
     contains (value)
     populate (fill collection)
     iterator.add ()
     iterator.remove ()
     

Set


     add (value)
     remove (value)
     contains (value)
     populate (fill collection)


**Comparisons should be made on the scale: 10K (10,000) 1000K 100K elements.**

**For each set of (10K, 100K, 1000K) execute at least 100 measurements and calculate the average value.**

**The results of measurements print to the console and saved in the file in a table view**
